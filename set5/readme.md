TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

The examples this week were fairly hard for me and I needed help from other students. 

The guest lecturers showing their projects were a great help. I should consider adding multiple datasets to a new perspective. 

Continue working on exercises that haven't passed tests and reading on python techniques.
