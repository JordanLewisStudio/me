TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This week I selected my dataset which originally was australian households use of information technology. I thought that was a bit boring so I did some more digging and found an interesting dataset on the amount of people who would get the covid-19 vaccine. (Data was collected from Jan-21 to May-21) 

The examples in IOexamples.py was helpful will have to practice with those new functions.
