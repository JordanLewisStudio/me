This week I selected my dataset which originally was australian households use of information technology. I thought that was a bit boring so I did some more digging and decided on comparing the Temperatures affect on birth rates in Australia. 

I am now going to think about how I want to present this information.

This weeks exercises were challenging and I needed help on most in exercise1.py. I think from here I need to work on my loops and looking further into working with json functions as well as reading and writing to files.

The examples in IOexamples.py was helpful will have to practice with those new functions.
