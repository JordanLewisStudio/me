TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Had a lot of difficulty with exercises this week. Need to do some more tutorials on loops and when to use certain functions. 

Also, could not use set3/tests.py for some reason? 

update: Did some tutorials on codeacademy for python and it has helped me with my understanding of python and it's uses which has been good.
