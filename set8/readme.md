TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

The quiz this week was challenging and I got stuck a few times on the later functions. I did a fair amount of prep for it and really felt my skills improving which helped in the exam. 

I now need to focus on finishing my data project. I feel more confident working on larger sets of data now so hopefully I can fly through the rest of the project.
