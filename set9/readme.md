TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Spent this lesson working on my data project. It has been coming along smoothly and the process has been more enjoyable. I am trying to configure climate change datasets into the project to see if there is any affect on birth and fertility rates. 

For the next week I'm going to continue to explore further down this path and continue work on the project.
