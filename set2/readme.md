This week was really challenging. I had to do a lot of online research to fully understand topics. 

The loop function I found difficult and still don't fully grasp the entirety of it, but I'm sure I will get it soon. 

I'm going to do some more reading and online tutorials so that I actually understand what I'm writing and how to use it in different situations.
