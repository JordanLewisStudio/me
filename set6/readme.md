TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Continued working on some python tutorials which have been helping me for the test in wk 8. The guest lecturers last week gave me a good understanding how how to begin structuring my data project. 

I am starting to see some results of comparing different weather data to birth rates. Now, I just need to think of the best way to show these results. I need to focus on 2-3 main conclusions and find a good visual way to display them.
