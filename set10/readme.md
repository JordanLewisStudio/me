TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This week I am finalizing my presentation. I have been planning out how I am going to expand on points and how I am going to group parts of my presentation while seeing if there is anything I need to add or explore further. 

One thing that is worrying is my co2 data. I'm not sure whether to keep it in my project or not as it doesn't add much. I was thinking of just using it to show how it has affected temperature over time. I'll look into this more over the next week.
