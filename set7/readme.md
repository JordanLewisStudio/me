TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

It was good to talk to some other people who were trying to find new ways to display their information. We exchanged some ideas and I came onto the a new data graph technique using 'seaborn'. I'm going to keep working on finding a graph that best suits each time of comparison I want to show. 

I have also been doing some extra work with python quizzes and tutorials so that I am best prepared for the exam in wk 8.
